Currently Complete:
- Tile map system (currently using basic sprites but can be swapped for Wendy and Chloe's work later)
- Player horizontal movement and state system
- PLayer Jump with all the bell and whistles

To Do:
- I will add in a basic enemy that can be "tethered to" and from there we can work in the mini game system
